# üìâ Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company by applying several classification algorithms, including SVM, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The workflow addresses class imbalance using SMOTE, incorporates hyperparameter tuning, and evaluates model performance through cross-validation. Some techniques and ideas were adapted from publicly available jupyter notebooks to enhance the analysis.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **churn_pred_final.ipynb** : Jupyter notebook containing the full EDA, preprocessing, SMOTE application, model tuning, and evaluation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of packages (optional)

## üß† Models Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Applied

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
